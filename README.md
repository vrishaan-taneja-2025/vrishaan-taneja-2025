## 👋 Who am I?

Hi, I’m **Vrishaan Taneja** — a CS student who loves building things **from scratch**.  
I enjoy going deep into systems, understanding how things *actually* work under the hood, and learning by building rather than following tutorials.

I’m especially interested in **systems programming, backend engineering, and applied ML**.
